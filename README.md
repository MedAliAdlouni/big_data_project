# Big Data Management and MapReduce Project

## Overview
This project is divided into two main parts, focusing on different aspects of big data management and processing:

1. **Big Data Management with MongoDB**: This section involves learning and applying MongoDB shell operations and aggregation queries to manage and analyze data.
2. **MapReduce**: This section focuses on understanding and implementing the MapReduce paradigm for distributed data processing, specifically for calculating word frequency in large document sets.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `part_1_mongodb.ipnyb`: Details the MongoDB part of the project, including basic shell operations and aggregation queries.
- `part_2_mapreduce.ipnyb`: Covers the MapReduce implementation for word frequency calculation in large datasets.

## Objectives

### MongoDB Section
- Gain proficiency with MongoDB shell operations.
- Learn to perform basic and advanced queries.
- Understand and apply aggregation operations.

### MapReduce Section
- Understand the fundamental concepts of MapReduce.
- Demonstrate the importance of multi-processing in distributed data treatment.
- Calculate word frequency in a large set of documents using MapReduce.
